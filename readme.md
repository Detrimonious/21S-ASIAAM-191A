"Maps have always been made; they may have been one of the first forms
of human communication. Maps exist in many forms, can represent
different ideas and are used for many purposes. In choosing what to
represent, how to represent it and what not to represent, maps are
expressions of power." --Logan Cochrane, Jon Corbett and Peter Keller,
Impact of Community-based and Participatory Mapping

**[Course Description]{.ul}**

Spatial data is all around us, whether its survey information with zip
codes or the various landmarks that comprise what people consider their
neighborhood. While maps, like census tracts or political boundaries are
traditionally extensions of authorities of power, participatory mapping
seeks to break down those barriers. The objective of this course is to
put mapping into the hands of students so that they can transfer these
skills and frameworks to civil society.

The way COVID-19 played out in the United States underscored the
institutional problems related to health, inequality, and the
environment in the United States of America. The global crisis of
climate change reinforces the institutional racism and environmental
issues that have proliferated far beyond the U.S. national borders.
Given all these issues, more so than ever, civil society is needed to
build the coalitions and reassess priorities to usher in an era of
political change.

Mapping and data are transformative tools that strengthen these
connections between coalitions because they are representations of the
physical world around us. However, in non-profits and other fields of
civic engagement, these tools are underutilized or simply seen as tools
"left to the experts". This course prepares students to be informed
digital citizens and transfer these tools for practical application in
civil society. The two main objectives for this course are, 1) to walk
away with technical web development skills relevant to mapping for civil
society, and 2) to apply an ethical mapping framework to such projects.

**[Course Objectives:]{.ul}**

-   Undertake analysis that are informed by critical data studies,
    participatory frameworks, social fieldwork, and ethical
    considerations.

-   Learn transferable technical data and mapping skills as applied
    through action-oriented, collaborative, and project-based research.

-   Learn to critically assess datasets, digital mapping/ visualization
    technologies for use in non-profits

-   Learn to create an interactive web map that uses community-based
    data from a non-profit or community-based organization

-   Perform a data needs assessment for non-profits for an interactive
    map that enhances the mission/goals of the organization

-   Learn to work in research teams in order to conceptualize, design,
    carry out, and deliver persuasive arguments through presenting a web
    site that includes a web map and other digital media.

Remote Learning Expectations for Students

Even though remote learning has been in session for more than a year,
students are expected to be respectful of various difficulties
associated with online instruction that others may have. I hope that you
will communicate with me if you experience anything in this course that
does not support an inclusive environment. You can also report any
incidents you may witness or experience online the Office of Equity,
Diversity, and Inclusion on [their website](https://equity.ucla.edu/).
Basic Zoom protocols for this course are as follows:

-   Mute microphones when not talking

-   Feel free to use the chat to ask questions at any time

-   Ensure that your preferred name and pronouns are included in your
    Zoom name

-   Though encouraged, video cameras are optional

    -   If cameras are turned off, please provide a profile picture

Lab Requirements

Lab assignments will require use of a text-based coding environment,
such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code in addition to QGIS (an open-source
desktop GIS software). Please be sure to have required software
installed prior to lab sessions. Reach out if there are any installation
issues or concerns before labs.

Lab Assistance

While the goal in the course is to ease everyone into GIS and writing
code, I understand that the process may be intimidating and difficult.
Rest assured that your success is my success, and I will try my best in
making a learning environment that breaks down these initial barriers.
We all have gone through the same struggles learning new technology, and
I strongly encourage you get help as often as possible. Steps for
troubleshooting technical problems can often be solved by a quick online
search or reviewing lab materials for a misstep. The class community
discussion on Slack is another resource for help.

Assignments and Evaluation:

Students will be evaluated based on individual lab assignments,
participation, and team based final project. Students are required to
attend all lectures and labs each week.

40% = Final group project (and project drafts, as noted on the syllabus)

40% = Interim class assignments

15% = Preparation and participation in class

Course Expectations:

UCLA's Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion provides resources,
events, and information about current initiatives at UCLA to support
equality for all members of the UCLA community. I hope that you will
communicate with me if you experience anything in this course that does
not support an inclusive environment, and you can also report any
incidents you may witness or experience on campus to the Office of
Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.

I expect you to take advantage of the opportunities that this course
offers you by being an active and thoughtful participant in all sections
and lectures, by coming to lecture and section prepared, and by trying
your best on the various elements of the course. I expect you to take
ownership of your learning and to reach out to me or your teaching
assistant if you are struggling or have concerns. I expect you to take
the opportunity to learn from your peers through activities in lecture
and section, and I expect you to be respectful and courteous to one
another. Finally, I expect you to hold yourself to the highest standards
for academic honesty and integrity in your work.

**Student Resources for Support and Learning**

**Providing feedback to me:** I encourage your feedback at any time
throughout the quarter about things that are helping you learn or
difficult concepts. Please communicate with me if there are ways that we
can improve the course to better support student learning.

**Personal Problems:** I understand that sometimes life makes it
difficult to focus on schoolwork. If you are having a personal problem
that affects your participation in this course, please talk to me to
create a plan. Please do not wait until the end of the quarter to share
any challenges that have negatively impacted your engagement and
academic performance. The sooner we meet, the more options we will have
available able to discuss to support your overall academic success.

**Academic Accommodations Based on a Disability:** Students needing
academic accommodations based on a disability should contact the Center
for Accessible Education (CAE) at (310)825-1501 or in person at Murphy
Hall A255. When possible, students should contact the CAE within the
first two weeks of the term as reasonable notice is needed to coordinate
accommodations. For more information visit
[www.cae.ucla.edu](http://www.cae.ucla.edu).

**Additional Course Policies and UCLA Policies**

**Message about Academic Integrity to all UCLA Students from UCLA Dean
of Students:**  UCLA is a community of scholars. In this community, all
members including faculty, staff and students alike are responsible for
maintaining standards of academic honesty. As a student and member of
the University community, you are here to get an education and are,
therefore, expected to demonstrate integrity in your academic endeavors.
You are evaluated on your own merits. Cheating, plagiarism,
collaborative work, multiple submissions without the permission of the
professor, or other kinds of academic dishonesty are considered
unacceptable behavior and will result in formal disciplinary proceedings
usually resulting in **suspension** or **dismissal**. 

**Forms of Academic Dishonesty:** As specified in the UCLA Student
Conduct Code, violations or attempted violations of academic dishonesty
include, but are not limited to, cheating, fabrication, plagiarism,
multiple submissions or facilitating academic dishonesty:

> **Cheating:** Unauthorized acquiring of knowledge of an examination or
> part of an examination

-   Allowing another person to take a quiz, exam, or similar evaluation
    > for you

-   Using unauthorized material, information, or study aids in any
    > academic exercise or examination -- textbook, notes, formula list,
    > calculator, etc.

-   Unauthorized collaboration in providing or requesting assistance,
    > such as sharing information

-   Unauthorized use of someone else's data in completing a computer
    > exercise

-   Altering a graded exam or assignment and requesting that it be
    > regraded

>  
>
> **Plagiarism:** Presenting another's words or ideas as if they were
> one's own

-   Submitting as your own through purchase or otherwise, part of or an
    > entire work produced verbatim by someone else

-   Paraphrasing ideas, data or writing without properly acknowledging
    > the source

-   Unauthorized transfer and use of someone else's computer file as
    > your own

-   Unauthorized use of someone else's data in completing a computer
    > exercise

> **Multiple Submissions:** Submitting the same work (with exact or
> similar content) in more than one class without permission from the
> instructor to do so. This includes courses you are currently taking,
> as well as courses you might take in another quarter
>
>  
>
> **Facilitating Academic Dishonesty:** Participating in any action that
> compromises the integrity if the academic standards of the University;
> assisting another to commit an act of academic dishonesty

-   Taking a quiz, exam, or similar evaluation in place of another
    > person

-   Allowing another student to copy from you

-   Providing material or other information to another student with
    > knowledge that such assistance could be used in any of the
    > violations stated above (e.g., giving test information to students
    > in other discussion sections of the same course)

> **Fabrication:** Falsification or invention of any information in an
> academic exercise

-   Altering data to support research

-   Presenting results from research that was not performed

-   Crediting source material that was not used for research

**Alternatives to Academic Dishonesty      **

-   **Seek out help** -- meet with your TA or Professor, ask if there is
    special tutoring available.

-   **Drop the course** -- can you take it next quarter when you might
    feel more prepared and less pressured?

-   **Ask for an extension** -- if you explain your situation to your TA
    or Professor, they might grant you an extended deadline.

-   **See a counselor** at Student Psychological Services, and/or your
    school, college or department -- UCLA has many resources for
    students who are feeling the stresses of academic and personal
    pressures.

Remember, **getting caught cheating affects more than just your GPA**.
How will you explain to your parents, family and friends that you have
been suspended or dismissed? How will it affect your financial aid award
and/or scholarship money? Will you be required to, and be able to pay
back that money if you are no longer a student? If you live in the
residence halls, where will you go if you are told you can no longer
live there?

You have worked very hard to get here, so don't cheat! If you would like
more information, please come see us at the Dean of Students' Office in
1206 Murphy Hall, call us at (310) 825-3871 or visit their website at
